# CODETECH-IT--HOME-AUTOMATION-WITH-BLUETOOTH-TASK-2

NAME : SRIMATHI

COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

INTERN ID : CT08QQF

DOMAIN : EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

DURATION :  FEBRUARY 5th, 2025 to MARCH 5th, 2025 (4 WEEKS)

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH

### **Objective**
To design a Bluetooth-controlled home automation system that allows users to switch two devices ON and OFF using both push buttons and Bluetooth commands. The system uses an Arduino microcontroller, Bluetooth module, and relays (or LEDs for simulation).

### **Key Components**
Arduino Microcontroller – The core processing unit that controls device states based on button presses or Bluetooth commands.
Push Buttons (Physical Control) – Two buttons allow manual toggling of Device 1 and Device 2.
Bluetooth Module (Wireless Control) – Enables wireless device control via Bluetooth commands sent from a smartphone.
Relays or LEDs – Simulate or control real electrical appliances by switching them ON or OFF.
Serial Communication – Sends status updates to the Serial Monitor for debugging and real-time monitoring.

### **Technology Used**
Embedded C (Arduino IDE) – Programming language for writing and executing the control logic.
SoftwareSerial Library – Enables communication between the Arduino and the Bluetooth module.
Digital Input Handling – Reads the state of physical buttons to trigger device control.
Bluetooth Communication (HC-05/HC-06) – Allows remote control of connected devices using smartphone apps.
Debouncing Mechanism – Ensures accurate button press detection without false triggers.

### **SIMULATOR OUTPUT**
